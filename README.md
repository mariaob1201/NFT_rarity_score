# plots_ararity_score
Provides an score on [0,100] points based on rarity of an item on a collection.

The idea is to provide a tool that allows to include attributes of specific items called Pots from a game called Runiverse. Those plots served as NFT and are usen in game to build on it or even substract items called physical resources that serves as a exchange coins or even as an elelements to build new items. This plots comes from Level Design Team and were designed by world region attributes, in that case there is a chance on each of them to having specific physical resource, thats why this comes as an opportunity to measure its rarity.
